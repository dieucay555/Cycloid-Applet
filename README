Cycloid Applet is a program to generate graphs of Curtate Cycloids, which are the curves produced by a point within a wheel, when that wheel is rotated.
The intended users of cycloid are makers of stringed instruments, but the program is available for anyone to use. Cycloid creates the graphs in PDF, PostScript,
or DXF format.

This is how I created the signed jar:
